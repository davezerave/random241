HOWTO build an Americium 241 driven random number generator
===========================================================

As a showcase I'll demonstrate the creation of my device below.
You'll need a couple of things to build an Americium 241 driven random number generator (rng).

###First things first though

**[Americium 241](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americium) is NOT A TOY!**
It's a transuranic radioactive chemical element. Respect working with it:

- Do not swallow it
- Don't wear it on your body
- Avoid touching it
- At best work in a safe environment (like a lab)
- Do not eat while working with it
- Keep in a closed steel or aluminium container, when not working with it

This being said, **I am not** responsible for any harm inflicted on you due to mal-handling of Americium 241!
Don't be a fool, work responsibly!

###Materials

####Americium 241
If you're living in the Americas, you'll most likely still have [ionization smoke detectors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americium#Ionization_detectors) around. For (mostly) everyone else, there's the possibility of ordering Americium on ebay!
As I live in Germany I opted for the second option (ionization detectors are not used in private households anymore). My sample came in a nice and useful shape:
